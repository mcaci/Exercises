 	Game Input

Initialization input
Line 1:factoryCount, the number of factories.
Line 2:linkCount, the number of links between factories.
Next linkCount lines: 3 space-separated integers factory1, factory2 and distance, where distance is the number of turns needed for a troop to travel between factory1 and factory2.
Input for one game turn
Line 1: an integer entityCount, the number of entities.
Next entityCount lines: an integer entityId, a string entityType and 5 integers arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4 and arg5.

If entityType equals FACTORY then the arguments are:
arg1: player that owns the factory: 1 for you, -1 for your opponent and 0 if neutral
arg2: number of cyborgs in the factory
arg3: factory production (between 0 and 3)
arg4: unused
arg5: unused
If entityType equals TROOP then the arguments are:
arg1: player that owns the troop: 1 for you or -1 for your opponent
arg2: identifier of the factory from where the troop leaves
arg3: identifier of the factory targeted by the troop
arg4: number of cyborgs in the troop (positive integer)
arg5: remaining number of turns before the troop arrives (positive integer)
Output for one game turn
The available actions are:
MOVE source destination cyborgCount: creates a troop of cyborgCount cyborgs at the factory source and sends that troop towards destination. Example: MOVE 2 4 12 will send 12 cyborgs from factory 2 to factory 4.
WAIT: does nothing.
If you try to move more cyborgs that there are in the source factory, then all the available units will be sent.
